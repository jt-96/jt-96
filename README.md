# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Jonathan Torrico, a Junior Web Developer from Mendoza, Argentina.

I started learning about software development around 6 years ago, at the time I was interested in Game Development.

After college, I decided that I wanted to be a web developer, so here I am, trying to learn new things to improve my skills as a Full-Stack Dev!

## What am I up to now?

  - Taking a break...

## What do I plan to do in the future?

  - Make new projects.
  - Update my portfolio.
